## Description

This was my semester project in which we were tasked with creating a website for a Community Science Museum. The intended audience comprised children between the ages of 7 and 15, as well as families with younger children and schools. The website was required to consist of a minimum of 4-6 pages, with the code written in semantically structured and neatly indented HTML. Additionally, we were expected to adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles for the CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). Furthermore, the site needed to be responsive to various screen sizes and devices.
